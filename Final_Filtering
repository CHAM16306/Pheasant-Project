## ORDER:

1.	MAF (get rid of hetero / missingness
2.	Missingness
3.	MAF again – because allele freqs would have changed
4.	HET (plink) 
5.	Thin – pop structure genomes. Need to remove linked loci – prob still remove, but measures of inbreeding don’t want it. 

→ create data set 1-4, then another for 5 i.e. different input sets. 

HWE not expected nc just some indvs from same sp from diff breders)
•	Decide analyses for inbreeding: what do these do to the data – important bc some filters may bias the data set
•	HET shouldn’t be higher than 0.5 – that’s the theoretical limit.

##do a heterozygosity filter - need to create a plink file first. 
#remember that HET in VCF tools is just a HARDY WEINBERG (which isn't expected bc these aren't actual populations, but individuals that are owned by different people that are members of the same species. 
 #Calculates a measure of heterozygosity on a per-individual basis. Specfically, the inbreeding coefficient, F, is estimated for each individual using a method of moments. The resulting file has the suffix ".het".

```


#heterozygosity 
```
/Users/aminachabach/Project/vcftools_0.1.13/plink-1.07-mac-intel/plink --file myplink.data --het

#output: 40515 (of 40515) markers to be included from [ myplink.data.map ]
#Writing individual heterozygosity information to [ plink.het ]
```

will need to filter out everything that is below 0.5 (theoretical filter). 
OUTPUT: 



#sort the data by p value? Or expected??

#alex said this should be in proportions but not sure?
```
sort -k 9,9 plink.het  (if p value in column 9)

#GET RID OF THEM: 
awk '(NR>1) && ($9 > 0.5 ) ' plink.het > plink.het.2
less plink.het.2

```
awk '(NR>1) && ($8 > 2 ) ' foo > bar
#where
#NR is number of record (that is number of line)
#$8 is eight field
#&& is logical and
#foo is the original file, unchanged
#bar resulting file
#implicit default action is to print the current input line
## at the moment this doesn't work: need to know how to output from plink.hwe.2
##need to make this file to import to R


#THIN filter
```
/users/bobbiecattani/Birds/vcftools/bin/vcftools --OUTPUTFILEFROMHET --thin 300 --recode --recode-INFO-all --out thinfilter
```


now not subsetting bc have a lot less data (prob under 3000)
